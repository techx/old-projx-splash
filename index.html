                LED Matrix Coffee Table

                An electronically adjustable-height coffee table with embedded Arduino-powered LED matrix.

            Have you ever looked at a piece of furniture and thought how much better it'd be with a LEDs or if it were automated? Take
            an ordinary table for example. Use it as a tracing table? Check! Play games like Snake and Tetris? Check! Show off
            to friends? Definitely check! Now imagine automation. An elegant coffee table that raises to become a stylish desk?
            Check! David Afolabi's 2014 xFair project was this stylish and futuristic table that can lighten up the mood with LEDs
            and raise and lower itself to match the user's height.
            <br>
            <br> The table is made of lasercut wood and uses linear actuators attached to the legs to change height. The 15x24 LED
            matrix made of Adafruit Neopixels is embedded under the polycarbonate table surface. The matrix is controlled by Arduino
            and can be programmed to display any pattern within its resolution. The Arduino is able to convert any image or video
            to format suitable for display on on the table, so any game that can fit in its 360-pixel resolution can be played
            right on the table through two custom-built controllers that interface with the Arduino controller.
            <br>
            <br> David brought a previous version of this table to the 2.007 Engineering Petting Zoo. With the support of ProjX, David
            received $500 to develop this second iteration of his project with greater LED count and vertical height adjustment.
            This project was displayed at xFair 2015!

                    ProjX is a branch of TechX that provides funding for MIT student projects that involve hardware. We fund students like you
                    every semester to bring their dream projects to life, then give you a chance to demo your creations at the annual

                <div class="answer">

                    We are in the process of modifying the mentorship program for ProjX. We hope to incorporate more involvement and support

                <div class="answer">
                    We believe in empowering students to explore and develop their ideas, so we will evaluate each application independently
                    of others. Therefore, a student can be on multiple teams; however, each student may only submit one application.

                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    Yes. We encourage students to pursue their passions and pivoting is an important part of innovating. As long as the new project
                    is legitimate and would have been funded on its own, projX will continue to support you. No, this will not affect
                    your applications aversely in the future.
