          LED Matrix Coffee Table
        </h1>
      <h5>
          An electronically adjustable-height coffee table with embedded Arduino-powered LED matrix.

        </h5>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      Have you ever looked at a piece of furniture and thought how much better it'd be with a LEDs or if it were automated? Take
      an ordinary table for example. Use it as a tracing table? Check! Play games like Snake and Tetris? Check! Show off
      to friends? Definitely check! Now imagine automation. An elegant coffee table that raises to become a stylish desk?
      Check! David Afolabi's 2014 xFair project was this stylish and futuristic table that can lighten up the mood with LEDs
      and raise and lower itself to match the user's height.
      <br>
      <br> The table is made of lasercut wood and uses linear actuators attached to the legs to change height. The 15x24 LED
      matrix made of Adafruit Neopixels is embedded under the polycarbonate table surface. The matrix is controlled by Arduino
      and can be programmed to display any pattern within its resolution. The Arduino is able to convert any image or video
      to format suitable for display on on the table, so any game that can fit in its 360-pixel resolution can be played
      right on the table through two custom-built controllers that interface with the Arduino controller.
      <br>
      <br> David brought a previous version of this table to the 2.007 Engineering Petting Zoo. With the support of ProjX, David
      received $500 to develop this second iteration of his project with greater LED count and vertical height adjustment.
      This project was displayed at xFair 2015!

        <div class="question">
          What is ProjX?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          ProjX is a branch of TechX that provides funding for MIT student projects that involve hardware. We fund students like you
          every semester to bring their dream projects to life, then give you a chance to demo your creations at the annual
          <a href="http://xfair.mit.edu/">xFair</a>.

        <div class="question">
          How much funding can I get?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          The maximum funding that the ProjX team can provide per team is projected to be $500.

          How do I apply for funding?

        <div class="answer">
          Applications are currently open! Please apply through <a href="https://techx.wufoo.com/forms/projx-funding-application-2015/">this form</a>.

        <div class="question">
          How is the mentorship structured?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          We are in the process of modifying the mentorship program for ProjX. We hope to incorporate more involvement and support
          via more directed and personal guidance from ProjX mentors.

        <div class="question">
          Can I get funding for multiple projects?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          We believe in empowering students to explore and develop their ideas, so we will evaluate each application independently
          of others. Therefore, a student can be on multiple teams; however, each student may only submit one application.

        <div class="question">
          Can I pivot from my original idea? If so, will this affect me aversely in the future?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          Yes. We encourage students to pursue their passions and pivoting is an important part of innovating. As long as the new project
          is legitimate and would have been funded on its own, projX will continue to support you. No, this will not affect
          your applications aversely in the future.

        <div class="answer">
          Yes. We want to promote the maker culture at MIT and will do our best to support all student projects, regardless of whether
          or not they are affiliated with projX.
