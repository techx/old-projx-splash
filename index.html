            How much funding can I get?

          <div class="answer">
            The maximum funding that the ProjX team can provide per team is 
            projected to be about $500.

            How is the mentorship structured?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            We are in the process of modifying the mentorship program for projX. 
            We hope to incorporate more involvement and support via more directed 
            and personal guidance from projX mentors.

            Can I get funding for multiple projects?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            We believe in empowering students to explore and develop their 
            ideas, so we will evaluate each application independently of others. 
            Therefore, a student can be on multiple teams; however, each student 
            may only submit one application.

            Can I pivot from my original idea? If so, will this affect me aversely
            in the future?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            Yes. We encourage students to pursue their passions and pivoting is an
            important part of innovating. As long as the new project is legitimate
            and would have been funded on its own, projX will continue to support 
            you. No, this will not affect your applications aversely in the 
            future.

            Yes. We want to promote the maker culture at MIT and will do our best
            to support all student projects, regardless of whether or not they are
            affiliated with projX.
